# 👋 Hey World, This is Yash Patil :) 
### Aspiring Software Developer | Java • Web Development • Open Source

I love building things that work in the real world.  
From desktop tools to small web applications, I enjoy exploring how software behaves, breaks, and gets better.  
Right now, I’m sharpening my foundation in **Core Java**, improving my logical thinking, and working on practical projects that help me understand real software development.

I’m equally curious about new tech trends — cloud fundamentals, API integrations, desktop frameworks, open-source tools — and I try to learn something small every day.

## 🔨 What I’m Building & Learning
- Writing cleaner, modular code with **Core Java** and OOP principles  
- Building frontend interfaces with **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap**  
- Developing desktop applications using **Electron.js**  
- Practicing **SQL** for database querying and data handling  
- Understanding the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**  
- Exploring **cloud basics** and how applications run behind the scenes  
- Contributing to projects and improving skills through open-source practices
